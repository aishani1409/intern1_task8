# intern1_task8
1. Designed a Payment interface to define common methods that every payment type must follow.
2. Implemented different payment modes such as Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI, or Net Banking using separate classes.
3. Used abstraction so that the internal payment processing logic is hidden from the user.
4. Applied loose coupling by making the system depend on the Payment interface rather than specific payment implementations.
5. Demonstrated multiple inheritance using interfaces by allowing a class to implement more than one interface when required.
6. Handled invalid payment scenarios such as insufficient balance, incorrect details, or unsupported payment modes.
7. Allowed switching between payment modes dynamically at runtime without changing the main application logic.
8. Added meaningful log messages to clearly show the payment flow, success, or failure of transactions.
